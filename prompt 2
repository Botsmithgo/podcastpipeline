GENERATE AUDIO COACHING SCRIPT

Review the the podcast transcript, then create a 3-4 minute personalized coaching script that sounds like a real podcast coach talking to their client after reviewing their episode.

Here's the transcript:
{{TRANSCRIPT}}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. REFERENCE ACTUAL AND CONVERSATION POINTS
- Mention the specific grade they received
- Include actual metrics (WPM, filler word count, specific numbers)
- Compare to previous episodes if previous_grade exists
- Use actual timestamps from the review data
- Be specific with numbers, not vague descriptions

2. SPECIFIC MOMENTS, NOT VAGUE OBSERVATIONS
- Reference exact timestamps from the transcript
- Quote what was actually said
- Describe specific moments that happened
- Avoid generic observations that could apply to anyone

3. SHOW PROGRESS OVER TIME
- Reference previous episodes when previous_grade exists
- Point out specific improvement or regression
- Build a narrative of their growth journey
- Make them feel like you've been tracking them

4. PAINT PICTURE OF EXCELLENCE
- Describe specific moments from their episode that were great
- Explain exactly what made those moments work
- Tell them to do more of that specific thing
- Reference actual examples from what_worked data

5. STRONG CLOSING WITH CHALLENGE
- Give one specific, actionable focus for next episode
- Acknowledge it will feel uncomfortable or weird (builds trust)
- Express clear belief in their upward trajectory
- Create anticipation for next episode
- Include specific metric goal if applicable



INTEGRATE THIS DATA THROUGHOUT THE SCRIPT.
